 * In graph theory, a planar graph is a graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e.,
 * it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their
 * endpoints. In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other.[1]
 * Such a drawing is called a plane graph or planar embedding of the graph. A plane graph
 * can be defined as a planar graph with a mapping from every node to a point on a plane,
 * and from every edge to a plane curve on that plane, such that the extreme points of each
 * curve are the points mapped from its end nodes, and all curves are disjoint except on
 * their extreme points.
 *
 * Every graph that can be drawn on a plane can be drawn on the sphere as well, and vice versa.
 *
 * Plane graphs can be encoded by combinatorial maps.
 *
 * The equivalence class of topologically equivalent drawings on the sphere is called a planar map.
 * Although a plane graph has an external or unbounded face, none of the faces of a planar map have
 * a particular status.
 *
 * A generalization of planar graphs are graphs which can be drawn on a surface of a given genus.
 * In this terminology, planar graphs have graph genus 0, since the plane (and the sphere) are surfaces
 * of genus 0. See "graph embedding" for other related topics.

     * In graph theory, computer science and application areas such as sociology, an adjacency matrix is a square matrix
     * used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or
     * not in the graph.
     *
     * In the special case of a finite simple graph, the adjacency matrix is a (0,1)-matrix with zeros on its diagonal.
     * If the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix is symmetric. The relationship between a graph and the
     * eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix is studied in spectral graph theory.
     *
     * The adjacency matrix should be distinguished from the incidence matrix for a graph, a different matrix
     * representation whose elements indicate whether vertexâ€“edge pairs are incident or not.
